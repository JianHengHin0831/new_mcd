# Order Flow Simulator (Vue Version)

This project is a **Vue.js reimplementation** of my earlier work

It demonstrates how customer orders move through different states:
- **Pending**
- **Processing**
- **Completed**

## Features
- Add and manage orders
- Update order status step by step (Pending → Processing → Completed)
- Responsive interface built with Vue.js
- Cleaner code structure compared to the vanilla JS version

## Tech Stack
- **Vue.js** (Composition API)

## Purpose
This project was created as a **learning exercise** after I started exploring Vue.js.  
It improves upon my earlier vanilla JS implementation by:
- Practicing Vue component-based design
- Managing state in a more structured way
- Building a more scalable version of the order management demo

## Project Status
This is a **practice project** for learning Vue.js.
